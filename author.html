        <p>
            Long before anime and manga fascinated young minds throughout the world, Japan's first science fiction writers emerged in the tumultuous post-war era. Their poignant, biting perspectives set the stage for Japan's globally successful fantasy media today.

          <h3>Obituary</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
          <em>by James Kirkup (Poet)
          <br>First published in The Independent (London) on February 16, 1998. Reprinted with permission</em>

          Shinichi Hoshi was one of the best-known specialists in Japan in "essu effu" (SF, or science fiction). As in Britain, SF was looked down upon as a lowly form of art by the Japanese literary establishment, but Hoshi succeeded in writing 1,000 stories, a world record, by 1983.

          <h3>The House that Never Slept</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
          <em>By Marina Hoshi Whyte (Daughter)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          My father always worked late. When I was young, I never saw him write. I used to think that writing was a profession that didn't require a lot of work. Every day, my father would wake around noon. Then he'd lay on the couch for a while, groggy, unclear. When I'd try to talk with him, he'd manage only a mumble: "Um..." or "Mu..."

          <em>Hoshi: According to an American Mom
          <br>by Kim Hines (Translation Editor)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I am - by no means - your typical science fiction fan. Like many moms, I don't like things that blow up, zip around at warp speed or vomit blue-green goo. Special effects do nothing for me. Multiple realities don't surprise me, either; I have three teenagers living at home, after all. Nor do I understand the need for an avatar ... unless, of course, she's going to tackle my real laundry room, in which case, bring her on! (And if she must have rock-hard abs while folding my bath towels, so be it.)
