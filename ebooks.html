        A Well-Kept Life is an emotional rollercoaster ride of science fiction by renowned Japanese author Shinichi Hoshi. A few of these famously "short-short" stories are as sweet and light as meringue; others will stew in the subconscious indefinitely. Hoshi nimbly reveals the gawky, awkward nature of modern man. He points out that we rarely talk face to face anymore; we've lost our connection to the natural world. Shiny, new technologies and bureaucracies continually promise to alleviate our existential discomfort. Yet, as Hoshi shows, the inventions that comprise "A Well-Kept Life" don't eliminate the pain. They simply reconfigure it. Many of Hoshi's stories were written for a multi-age audience. But these are decidedly adult. Never graphic, nor gory, nor vulgar in any way, Hoshi manages to unnerve his readers with the simplest of language and barest of plots. Written between 1960 and 1984, these parables grow increasingly more spot-on with age. A Well-Kept Life is a blast of warning signals for today, a whistle-blower's global call to attention.

        The Whimsical Robot is a beloved collection of 'short-shorts,' wholesome science fiction made famous by celebrated Japanese author Shinichi Hoshi. The stories are almost a half-century old, yet they speak to current, very urgent matters of today. Written for school-age children, the stories charm and challenge readers of all ages. Ever so gently, they rattle our deepest fears about humanity's blind embrace of science and technology. The collection is as much a moral argument as it is a literary joyride: fables for the high-tech era. Whereas Aesop employed animals, Hoshi's stories feature curious space aliens, dubious scientists, half-baked inventions, foolhardy investors and capricious machinery. The Whimsical Robot is considered a true classic in Japanese youth literature. Many describe it as a perfect entry for young readers. This English version opens up the collection to an even wider audience of young - and not-so-young - next-generation Hoshi fans.

        Written in 1969, Voice Net is a haunting forecast of today's internet-crazed, cell-phone-centered world. It unnervingly foretells the ethical quandaries plaguing today's information society. Shinichi Hoshi's futuristic story is set in the banally dubbed "Honeydew Condominium," a modern, twelve-story complex just outside the city. It starts at the gift shop on the building's first floor. The lackluster shop owner routinely uses his telephone to do just about everything: from counting cash register receipts to monitoring his vital signs. The story follows the seasons as it climbs floor to floor, watching people's lives change under an increasingly ubiquitous network of machines. But is the computer's all-seeing power antithetical to humanity? The author offers a surprising twist on this longstanding debate.

        Who are we when we dream? What would we learn about other people if we could visit their dream worlds? Shinichi Hoshi put forth these stirring questions in The Other Side of the Swing.<br><br>The story's main character is a typical school boy, ripe with curiosity. One day, the boy finds himself lost in a dream world. In fact, it is his father's dream world: a place where his dad is young and carefree forever. Lured by this fairytale beginning, readers soon find themselves wandering through the cavernous folds of other people's dreams and realities.<br><br>Originally written as a full-length fantasy adventure in 1971, this abridged version of The Other Side of the Swing is a beautifully illustrated picture book for young readers. Playful acrylic paintings by illustrator Takashi Goto of Tokyo set the author's written words in motion.
